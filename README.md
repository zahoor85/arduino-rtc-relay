# Smart Timer Relay Controller

## Overview

The **Smart Timer Relay Controller** is an Arduino-based project designed to automate the control of an LED (or other electronic devices) based on specific hours of the day. By utilizing a Real-Time Clock (RTC) module, this project can efficiently manage the on/off state of connected devices, enhancing convenience and energy efficiency.

## Features

- Turns an LED (or other devices) on or off at predefined hours.
- Utilizes the DS1307 RTC module for accurate timekeeping.
- Simple and easy to set up with minimal components.
- Serial output for debugging and monitoring time.

## Components Required

To set up this project, you will need the following components:

- **Arduino Board** (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- **DS1307 RTC Module**
- **Relay Module** (for controlling the LED or other devices)
- **LED** (or any other device you want to control)
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard** (optional)
